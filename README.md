practises, an analysis of a dataset that contains data on medical 
procedures, prescriptions, and medications in this study. 
The dataset contains details 
on medical practices, such as names, addresses, and postcodes; prescriptions written 
by these practices, such as quantities, actual costs, and BNF codes; and medications, 
which are categorised according to their chemical components, BNF descriptions, and 
BNF chapters. This dataset will be examined to find trends, patterns, and insights that 
may assist healthcare professionals in making better decisions and enhancing patient
